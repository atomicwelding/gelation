# gelation

This is the repository of my first year of graduate studies lab project I am broadly studying percolation theory in gel systems and the conformations of low-functionnality polymers.

## Repository structure 

```
* simple-models/
  ** bethe.py  : Describes gelation using mean-field theory approximation
  Gelation transition occurs on a Bethe lattice, a special type of bond-
  percolation model (oftenly called Bernouilli percolation)
```
